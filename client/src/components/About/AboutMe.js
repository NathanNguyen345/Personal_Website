      <p>
        Besides working, I try my best to find time for my hobbies. I love to
        travel whenever I have free time. Whenever I do, I carry around my
        camera by my side. I like taking pictures of random animals on my
        journey. I am also a big foodie, but still trying to get a grip of
        taking nice food pictures. I tend to eat the food before I can think of
        a nice composition. I love sports cars and often try to find a nice
        skyline to take pictures of them. However, my favorite of them all is
        landscape photography. Something about landscape photography just makes
        me feel at ease and isolated from the rest of the world. What I enjoy
        most about it is that I get that time to just forget everything in the
        world and wait for that perfect sunset or sunrise that just warms my
        soul.
